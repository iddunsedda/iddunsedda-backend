# Content Notes
This is intended to be a basic outline of Autumn-long, the game I'm making in Node.js and React. It's heavily derived from the classic board game Talisman, and follows the Norse myth of the kidnapping of the goddess Idunn by the giant Thjazi.

## Basic Overview
The game takes place across three realms: Midgard, the realm of men; Asgard, the home of the Aesir; finally, Jotunheim, the land of the giants. The final battle with Thjazi takes place at his home, Thymheim, high up in the mountains of Jotunheim. To advance from one area to the next, the player must advance their strength and craft skills in order to defeat the enemies in each realm and to pass the barriers between worlds.

The player begins in Midgard, having heard sightings of the great Jormungandr, the World Serpent. Legend has it that those who can find and lift it are granted access to Asgard and given the favor of the gods. The player wanders Midgard in search of the serpent, growing stronger and cannier as they go; finally, they are rewarded with an opportunity to lift the gigantic snake. Should they succeed, they are greeted by the Rainbow Bridge, and may pass to Asgard.

Once in Asgard, the player reaches the hall of the gods and is informed that, due to Idun's kidnapping, their powers are much reduced and the player must go on their behalf to rescue the goddess of youth. However, before the player is granted the divine gifts needed to reach Jotunheim, they must prove their intelligence as well as their strength; after all, giants are crafty as well as strong, and the gods have only one opportunity to get their youth back. After wandering Asgard for a time, the player must pass a battle of wits with the trickster god Loki; they are then given Freyja's magical hawk feathers that allow them to fly the great distance to Jotunheim.

In Jotunheim, the player must fight their way to the great hall Thrymheim, defeating trolls, giants and other magical enemies. At Thrymheim, the player must wound the giant Thjazi who has captured Idun. Once the player has stunned the giant, they change back into their hawk form, pick up the goddess of youth, and speed back to Asgard with the furious giant in pursuit in the form of an eagle. The Aesir, eagerly awaiting their return, have built a huge bonfire at the outskirts of Asgard; once the player and Idun are safely past, they light the fire and the giant Thjazi is consumed by the flames.

The player returns to Midgard with the promise that they will be in the gods' favor forever and will be honored in Valhalla at the end of their time on earth.
